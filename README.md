Sumitarian State
================

A terribly hacked-together interpretation of [Eve](http://witheve.com/)

The name "sumitarian" is a play on "totalitarian". Nothing is meant by that;
it's just a name referring to the fact that this system is fairly opinionated
and restricting in what it allows the programmer to do.
